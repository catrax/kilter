# Features
- Voltage controlled filter with 4 simultaneous outputs:
	- 1-pole high pass
	- 2-pole low pass
	- 2-pole band pass (it's kind of an afterthought and needs to be improved, but it sounds okay)
	- 2-pole notch with adjustable depth (via trimmer on back)
- Two frequency CV inputs, one with an attenuverter
- Voltage controlled resonance with adjustable drive
- Two inputs with linear cross-fade
- 6HP
