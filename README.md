# VCF-20
A compact multimode eurorack filter with MS-20 style resonance.
Filter core and resonance based on [Ren√© Schmitz' MS-20 schematic](https://www.schmitzbits.de/ms20.html).

# Features
- Voltage controlled filter with 4 simultaneous outputs:
	- 2-pole high pass
	- 2-pole low pass
	- 1.5?-pole band pass (it's kind of an afterthought and needs to be improved, but it sounds okay)
	- 2-pole notch with adjustable depth (via trimmer on back)
- Two frequency CV inputs, one with an attenuverter
- Voltage controlled resonance with adjustable drive
- Two inputs with linear cross-fade
- 6HP
