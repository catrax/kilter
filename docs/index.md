# (Off) Kilter
Kilter is a 6HP multimode resonant filter based on the Korg MS-20 (yes, yet
another MS-20 clone).

It offers four simultaneous responses, two CV inputs with an attenuverter, two
crossfaded inputs, and voltage controlled resonance with particularly messy
overdrive, all in a compact form factor.
